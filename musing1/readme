Recently, I found myself wondering what truly came first in the universe. That question pulled me into a deeper reflection: so much of what we explore and measure is relative to light, 
yet light and heat themselves are born from fusion inside stars. In a very real sense, life came from the stars. But stars only exist because gravity pulls matter inward, causing collapse, 
ignition, and structure. Gravity gives rise to stars, planets, and entire galaxies. This led me to a simple but powerful thought: perhaps gravity is the most fundamental force in the 
universe. I don’t yet know whether it has two poles—gravity and antigravity—or if antigravity exists at all, and if it does, where it might be found.

  When I zoom out and look at the universe on its largest scales, I can’t ignore its web-like structure. That visual sparked a second hypothesis. What if gravity itself is filamentary 
in nature? What if mass forms preferentially along these gravitational filaments, much like iron filings align along magnetic field lines? In this view, galaxies, stars, planets, 
and even black holes are not randomly distributed, but emerge where gravitational strands are strongest. The cosmic web would then be a direct map of gravity’s structure itself. Now comes 
the hard part: grounding these ideas in research, mathematics, and calculations to see whether this line of thought can stand up to scrutiny.
